# Recreate the <blink/> tag
Nostalgic for the web back in the 90's? Let's bring it back by implementing an HTML element that brought the fire to everyone's MySpace pages -- the blink tag.

**For those of y'all that weren't around for it the blink tag did the following:**
* was an HTML tag called `<blink>`
* anything placed inside `<blink>example</blink>` would be visible for 1/4 of a second and then hidden for the subsequent 1/4 second.
* This on/off cycle would loop endlessly

## Instructions
Using HTML, CSS, React/JSX, or any combination thereof, please create a blink element that meets these requirements:
* Contents of the tag should alternate between **visible / invisible** in **.25 second intervals**.
* Surrounding content should not shift in position as a result of the blinking content.
* Applying/Removing the blink effect can be done by adding/removing a CSS class name or placing the content inside a React component.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
